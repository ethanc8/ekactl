\begin{definition}[Two-dimensional real-coordinate space ($\Real^2$)] 
  \[
    \Real^2 = \{ (x, y) : x, y \in \Real \}
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Three-dimensional real-coordinate space ($\Real^2$)] 
  \[
    \Real^3 = \{ (x, y, z) : x, y, z \in \Real \}
  \]

  $x, y, z$ should be presented such that the coordinate system is right-handed ($\khat = \ihat \crossp \jhat$ should have direction according to the right-hand rule).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Standard basis vectors] The standard basis vectors of a space are the unit vectors that go along the axes of the space. All vectors in that space can be expressed as sums of scalar multiples of the standard basis vectors of that space.

The standard basis vectors of $\Real_2$ are $\ihat$ and $\jhat$, also called $\mathbf{e_1}$ and $\mathbf{e_2}$.

The standard basis vectors of $\Real_3$ are $\ihat$, $\jhat$, and $\khat$, also called $\mathbf{e_1}$, $\mathbf{e_2}$, and $\mathbf{e_3}$.
\end{definition}
