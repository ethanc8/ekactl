\section{Electrostatics}

\begin{definition}[Electric charge] A scalar quantity that can describe an object. It can be positive or negative
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Elementary charge ($e$)] The smallest possible charge $e \approx 1.6 * 10^{-19} \, \Coulomb$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Charging}

\begin{procedure}[Charging by friction] Rub two nonconductive objects together. The one with the greater electron affinity (electronegativity) becomes negatively charged.
\end{procedure}

\begin{procedure}[Polarization] When two objects near each other, their charge distributions will change in order to ensure that similar charges in the different objects don't get too near each other.
\end{procedure}

\subsection{Coulomb's Law}

\begin{definition}[Coulomb's constant ($k$)]
  \[
    k \approx 8.99 * 10^9 \, \frac{\Newton \meter^2}{\Coulomb^2}
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{namedlaw}[Coulomb's Law]
  If two objects with charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are near each other, then the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the two objects is
  \[
    |F_e| = \frac{k |q_1| |q_2|}{r^2}
  \]
\end{namedlaw}
